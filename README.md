### Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹
I am currently learning HTML and CSS.  
If I am not learning or working, I am having fun with my family. I do other things that I am not particularly good at, but I enjoy the process and the feeling of improving.  
Whenever I am doing something else, I have this thought like a Montra, "you could be practicing or learning more about coding."
