### Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹
I am currently learning HTML and CSS.  
Whenever I am doing something else, I have this thought like a Montra, "you could be practicing or learning more about coding." If I am not learning or working, I am having fun with my family. I do other things that I am not particularly good at, but I enjoy the process and the feeling of improving.  
I hope you all have a better tomorrow! Thank you for stopping by 

Other things I can't live without: U+1F9AE U+1F958 U+1F6B4 U+1F9D8 U+200D U+2642 U+FE0F U+1F4F7 U+1F4D6 U+1F3A7 U+2615
